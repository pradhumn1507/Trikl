# MERN Image Editing Web App

This is a web application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack that allows users to upload an image, add multiple logos or images on top of it, overlay text, and download the final edited image.

## Project Overview

### Features

- Upload an image or provide the URL of an image.
- Add multiple logos or images on top of the uploaded image.
- Add overlay text with customizable style, font size, color, and position.
- Preview the edited image in real time.
- Download the final edited image.
- User authentication (optional) to save editing sessions.

### Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

- **backend**: Contains the Express.js server code, MongoDB configuration, and image upload logic.
- **frontend**: Contains the React.js frontend code, user interface components, and image editing functionality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system.
- MongoDB database connection URI (you can use MongoDB Atlas or a local MongoDB instance).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-image-editing-app.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd mern-image-editing-app
Install dependencies for the backend and frontend:


# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
Configuration
Create a .env file in the backend directory and set the following environment variables:


Copy code
PORT=3001
MONGODB_URI=YOUR_MONGODB_URI_HERE
Replace YOUR_MONGODB_URI_HERE with your MongoDB database connection URI.

Optionally, create a .env file in the frontend directory to define any frontend-specific environment variables (e.g., for API endpoints).

Running the Application
Start the backend server from the backend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm start
This will start the Express.js server on port 3001 (or the port specified in your .env file).

In a separate terminal, start the frontend development server from the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm start
This will start the React.js development server and open the web app in your default web browser.

You can access the web application at http://localhost:3000 by default.

Usage
Upload an image by clicking the "Upload" button or providing the URL of an image.
Add logos or images by using the provided tools.
Add text overlays with customizable style options.
Preview the edited image in real time.
Download the final edited image.
Deployment
To deploy the application to a production environment, follow your hosting provider's instructions for deploying Node.js and React.js applications. Be sure to set up environment variables for production.
